## Precondition

The Smart Swimming Pool project uses Homie 3.0 based MQTT messaging. Therfor you have to install 
an MQTT broker in your environment.

### Raspberry Pi

I use an Raspberry Pi (Model 3) ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/2NnqwDQ)). The latest version of openHAB has an embedded MQTT broker. In this example a seperate broker [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) on same Raspberry Pi is configured.

### Install Mosquitto

- Install Mosquitto on Raspberry Pi:
  ``` 
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo apt-get install mosquitto
  ```
- In Paper UI install add-on 'MQTT Binding' from bindings.
- Check `services/mqtt.cfg` for your environment.
